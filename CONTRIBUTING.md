# Contributing to fuckingcodesigning.com

Your help is GREATLY appreciated!

If you have experienced a specific Xcode error or issue related to code signing, please help 
others by contributing your experience and solution as a post.

This website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). If you are unfamiliar, Jekyll
compiles Markdown in to a static HTML website, so contributing content to this website is
as simple as adding a Markdown file.

### Creating a new post
To add a new post, simply create a new Markdown file that matches the following naming convention:

`YYYY-MM-DD-short-title-of-your-post.md`

Then, edit the file and add a Jekyll "front matter" block at the top:

```md
---
layout: post
title:  "The title of your post"
categories: identities
---
```

This block tells Jekyll which layout to use for the page (`post`), sets the post/page title, as well as 
any relevant categories that can be used for organizing and grouping related posts.

After the front matter block, add your post content in simple Markdown. Refer to the
[Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) if you need more advanced formatting options (i.e. syntax highlighting).
